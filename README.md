## 🔧 **Setup & Installation**
Follow these steps to use the model:

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Saurabh1207/Hindi_SpeechT5_finetuned
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.  
Run the following:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git accelerate datasets soundfile speechbrain torch
```

### **3. Inference Code: Generate Hindi Speech**
Here’s an example of how you can use the model to generate speech from Hindi text:

```python
import os
import torch
from IPython.display import Audio
import soundfile as sf
from speechbrain.pretrained import EncoderClassifier
from transformers import SpeechT5Processor, SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech, SpeechT5HifiGan

# Load a sample from the dataset for speaker embedding
processor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
vocoder = SpeechT5HifiGan.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_hifigan")
spk_model_name = "speechbrain/spkrec-xvect-voxceleb"
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
speaker_model = EncoderClassifier.from_hparams(source=spk_model_name, run_opts={"device": device}, savedir=os.path.join("/tmp", spk_model_name))

try:
    dataset = load_dataset("mozilla-foundation/common_voice_17_0", "hi", split="validated", trust_remote_code=True)
    dataset = dataset.cast_column("audio", Audio(sampling_rate=16000))
    sample = dataset[0]
    speaker_embedding = create_speaker_embedding(sample['audio']['array'])

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error loading dataset: {e}")
    # Use a random speaker embedding as fallback
    speaker_embedding = torch.randn(1, 512)

def create_speaker_embedding(waveform):
    with torch.no_grad():
        speaker_embeddings = speaker_model.encode_batch(torch.tensor(waveform))
        speaker_embeddings = torch.nn.functional.normalize(speaker_embeddings, dim=2) 
        speaker_embeddings = speaker_embeddings.squeeze().cpu().numpy()
    return speaker_embeddings

# Load processor and fine-tuned model
processor = SpeechT5Processor.from_pretrained("microsoft/speecht5_tts")
model = SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech.from_pretrained("Saurabh1207/Hindi_SpeechT5_finetuned")

# Define input text in Hindi
input_text = "नमस्ते, यह हिंदी टेक्स्ट टू स्पीच मॉडल का परीक्षण है।"

# Preprocess text
inputs = processor(text=input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate speech
speech = model.generate_speech(inputs["input_ids"], speaker_embeddings, vocoder=vocoder)
Audio(speech.numpy(), rate=16000)

# Save audio file
sf.write("hindi_output.wav", speech.cpu().numpy(), 16000)
print("Hindi speech generated and saved as 'hindi_output.wav'")
```

## 🚀 **How to Fine-Tune Further?**
For advanced users, fine-tuning the model on a **custom dataset** is simple:  
1. Prepare a dataset with Hindi text and corresponding audio files.  
2. Use the Hugging Face `SpeechT5ForTextToSpeech` API to fine-tune the model further.  
3. Save and test the optimized model for improved results.
